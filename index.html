          <p>We measure and define happiness! :-)</p>

<p>Our application allows people to measure their happiness level and any changes in happiness and mood over time.  Reviewing historical changes in mood enables an understanding for determining if there may be any patterns and correlations to other life events. In addition to individual user analytics, users will be able to review their individual happiness against the aggregated analysis of their circle of friends and other regionally and globally aggregated datasets.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, that privacy is a primary concern, and at no time, will users be able to see other user’s individual happiness other than when it is aggregated as part of a group.</p>

<p>A basic assumption of our system is that the user data is already provided and/or generated.  Our system will focus on the trending and analytics of the dataset from a user’s perspective.</p>
